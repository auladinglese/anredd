# Anredd

Intended to target the specific need of EFL learners of using articles (a/an/the) more fluently. Uses real-time data
from the Reddit API to retrieve longer texts from /r/writingprompts and strips the articles before allowing the user
to select the original article.

<b>Directions for future development (PRs welcome!)</b>

-switch process of user interaction to supplying articles instead of selecting them (possibly using an angular editable directive
or some other 'click to edit' functionaility
